LightCart is built primarily for small-scale e-commerce web sites where inventory management does not matter. All products and prices and images are mentioned in the HTML file.

Any level of customization can be achieved by tweaking the HTML, CSS and core.js files.

It is built using XHTML-CSS, jQuery and PHP. The demo page is cross-browser compatible.

Currently only CCAvenue payment gateway is supported, due to lack of support for it.
