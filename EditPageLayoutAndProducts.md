<strong>index.html</strong>
<p>Make sure you leave the class names as they are unless you are very sure of what you are doing. The functioning of the system depends on classes and id's. You can enter the product's image, name and description as mentioned. Make sure you enter the price in the span element.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You can add any number of products by copying and pasting the exact same code as in the demo. Please note that product's ID attribute is the product's ID which will be saved in the Excel sheet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Don't touch the form!</p>

<strong>assets/css/lightcart.css</strong>
<p>This is the stylesheet of the page. You can edit this safely to achieve your results. The elements are not ordered very well. Apologies for this.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<strong>assets/js/core.js</strong>
<p>Please don't edit this file unless you know exactly what you are doing. It is completely built using the jQuery framework. The code is pretty self explanatory and not very well documented. Apologies again.</p>
